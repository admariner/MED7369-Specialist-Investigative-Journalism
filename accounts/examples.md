# Examples of company accounts

*Copies of all of the following can be found in the examples folder.*

* Chesterfield FC: [CFC 2001 Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04273743/filing-history): example of controversial chairman's statement.
* [Fifty Shades Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07934674/filing-history): stories can be told about how much money an author is making, and whether that is increasing or decreasing.
* [Sainsbury's Annual Report 2017](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/investors/annual-report-2017): example of the detail provided by accounts for a large listed company.
* [Clink Beer Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10175510/filing-history): example of the detail provided by micro company accounts.
* [Ghetto Golf Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10775584/officers): this company is very new so may not even have accounts. But their page is useful to identify [company officers](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10775584/officers) and other companies they are/have been involved in, whose accounts might also provide more info.
* [DJS (UK) Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07952979/filing-history): example of the detail provided by a small company - there is no profit and loss shown. However, it does detail that the parent company is DJS Holding Limited, and [the accounts for that parent company](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08499088/filing-history) actually show the profit for DJS (UK) Ltd.
* [DJS Holding Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08499088/filing-history): example of a **dormant** company. Even though it is 'dormant' it still provides details on the profit of the company that it owns, DJS (UK) Ltd.
* [Urban Outreach](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03019108/filing-history): example of a 'related party transactions' statement which could be further explored.
  * Checking [pages on the director](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/search?q=sam+lancaster) highlights that sometimes the same person has multiple entries - but their address or date of birth is the same.
  * Checking [that person's appointments and their dates](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/x4LVAO9uIaECmE9i-Ql2iVCz5_I/appointments) reveals some other interests that are relevant and perhaps should have been declared.
  * Because it is a charity [you will also find information on trusteeships on the Charity Commission website](http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1044203&subid=0)
* Declarations of interest should show which companies people have an interest in (e.g. directorships, shareholdings). [This is an example of a declaration for a school board of governors]( http://www.vyners.hillingdon.sch.uk/attachments/download.asp?file=2744&type=pdf)
  * You can check if they've declared everything by searching for them on Companies House. [Here's one search](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07796938/officers) and the [appointments for that person](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/OLzlP_d49cU45o3w8XTXfkZ0qVo/appointments), and [for another](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/-1LyqMyHWGXvjVOi6RFHor_dI-Q/appointments) which don't appear on the declaration.
* A 'Going concern' statement can indicate trouble for an organisation. [This Guardian story on the London Garden Bridge project](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/11/london-garden-bridge-project-future-doubt-trustees) comes from such a statement [in their annual accounts](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08755461/filing-history)
* [This story about a care home company blaming problems on Brexit and council cuts](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/15/debt-laden-four-seasons-health-care-suffers-275m-loss) also comes from a similar statement - you can find it in the [2016 accounts for Four Seasons Health Care](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/FC016792/filing-history)
* [These accounts on the Charity Commission website](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends51/0000213251_AC_20170331_E_C.PDF) for leprosy charity [Lepra](http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=213251&subid=0) highlight the effect of Brexit on exchange rates and reduced value of donations.
* [Carillion's 2016 accounts](http://www.annualreports.co.uk/Company/carillion-plc) provide an example of the problems with **intangible assets**, specifically **goodwill**: as [one comment piece points out](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/capita-carillion-outsourcing-local-elections-aditya-chakrabortty): "Carillion repeatedly pulled forward hundreds of millions on profits expected from future work, and paid that cash out to shareholders. Since the huge profits it was booking did not exist, it had to borrow the cash it paid out to shareholders – and the debt was secured against goodwill: its brand name, relations with customers and staff. However hard such things are to value, Carillion reckoned that they were worth a tidy £1.57bn. As MPs discovered to their amazement in January, “goodwill” was Carillion’s single biggest asset."
* [MI Homecare's accounts](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/MI_Homecare_execpay.pdf) show a big cut in staff, while executive pay increased. Check out their entry in gender pay gap data (which is what led me to this company) to get extra context.
* [Urban Outreach's accounts](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/UrbanOutreach2017.pdf) show they took out a bond with a company connected with an executive. [This is the story that was written up after I tipped off the Bolton News]()
