# Company accounts: key points

Below are some of the key points to remember when dealing with company accounts in the UK. Corporate Watch's [page on understanding company accounts](https://corporatewatch.org/understanding-company-accounts/) provides some useful explanation and walkthroughs too.

## Company accounts: ingredients

Company accounts have many parts but broadly speaking there are three parts:

* **Reports/statements** - from directors, accountants, etc. These are normally quite dull or routine or attempt to mask the reality. However, occasionally people stray from the script and make controversial statements that can be newsworthy (such as a football chairman criticising the fans)
* **Cash flow** - this is what you expect from accounts: where money is going. Not only does this include obvious things like profit and loss but also trends (amounts going up or down), tax, problems (debt, costs) and clues (unusual payments)
* **Notes to the accounts** - you don't need to understand numbers to get stories from accounts. Many of the notes contain interesting nuggets that can be followed up or reported. The devil is also in the detail here when it comes to specifics about things like tax (what was actually paid, when factors were taken into account)

## Different types of company publish different amounts of information

* **Small companies** only have to publish abbreviated accounts
* **Medium** companies need to publish profit & loss (P&L), and a balance sheet
* **Listed** companies use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) so as to be comparable with others around the world. They will publish a lot more detail, particularly on things like remuneration of directors.
* **Large** companies can use IFRS or UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UKGAAP) in the UK and publish more detail than a medium company
* **Charities** must also submit information to the Charity Commission, which publishes it too
* **Community Interest Companies** (CICs) "must prepare and deliver to Companies House a ‘community interest company report’ made up to the same date as the accounts" ([source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-of-a-company-annual-requirements/life-of-a-company-part-1-accounts#community-interest-companies-cics))
* **Dormant** companies are exempt from having an audit for that financial year. [More information on Gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-of-a-company-annual-requirements/life-of-a-company-part-1-accounts#dormant-company-accounts)
* **Micro-entity** companies are a subset of small companies, but "can prepare and file a balance sheet with a reduced set of information than that required by a small, medium or large company." ([source](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/life-of-a-company-annual-requirements/life-of-a-company-part-1-accounts#micro-entity-accounts))
* **Self-employed** people are not companies. Although they file accounts they do not send them to Companies House. The main reason for setting up a limited company is that it provides a level of protection: if anything goes wrong the company might go into administration instead of the person losing their house or property.

## Related party transactions

* At the end of the report
* Helps identify parent company, etc.
* Look out for licence payments etc. (tax avoidance? Wealth extraction?)
* Look out for missing info, e.g. relationships that should have been declared

## Ultimate controlling party

Which company ultimately controls this one. May not be the same as owners. Who owns controlling voting shares, or combines to do so.

Look for: conflicts of interest, back-scratching.

## Going concern

Does it expect to be able to operate for the next year (the “foreseeable future”)? Is this dependent upon support from parent company etc.?

**'Emphasis of matter'** indicates some doubt about future and involves assumptions (e.g. that loans will be renewed). Delayed accounts indicate attempts to avoid including these assumptions (get confirmation on loans first)

## Tax

Look for notes to accounts for tax (typically no.9) which will explain *real* tax after things like 'deferred tax' (to be paid in the future) as well as reasons why.

See previous year cash flow for actual payment compared to the previous accounts' estimate.

## Interest repayments

Who is it paid to? Check Related Party Note. Is it another company in the parent group? Based in tax haven? Luxembourg, Netherlands, Ireland, etc. On what terms? Fixed/variable interest? Term?

## Dividends

If dividends are being paid when company is making a loss, or if they are a high proportion of profit that is not a good sign.

## Balance statement jargon

* **Cost of sales** = cost of buying or making stuff
* **Administrative expenses** = other costs
* **Depreciation** = losing money on things, e.g. a train company owns trains which lose value over time as potentially saleable assets. Do assets depreciate at same rate as similar businesses?
* **Assets** = what you own
  * **Fixed assets** = held for long term use, e.g. buildings, vehicles, factories
  * **Intangible assets** = invisible, e.g. brands, ‘Goodwill’. Check these don’t contribute too much to net worth
  * **Current assets** = stock/inventory - could be obsolete, worthless, take too long to sell
  * Cost of sales / value of stock = **turnover rate** (e.g. stock sold 10 times over this year)
* **Liabilities** = what you owe
  * **Current liabilities** are those due within 12 months from the end of the year. Should be less than current assets (inc. cash) - otherwise they can’t pay!
  * **Long term liabilities** may include long term loans - but if certain conditions are breached (covenants) these can become payable immediately.
* **Creditors** = people the company owes money to.
  * **Trade creditors** are suppliers who have provided goods on credit. If there are none, it may be because they no longer trust company to pay. A company may earn interest if they take cash from customers but pay suppliers on credit (e.g. a month later). Supermarkets do this for example.
  * **Creditors - other** includes money owed to related companies (check Related Party Transactions for details - debt is one way to avoid paying tax in UK while extracting money to other territories), and tax liabilities.
* **Net worth** = assets minus liabilities
* **Capital and reserve (Cash)**
* **From operating activities** = what they normally do
* **From investing activities** = money spent on expansion, or generated from selling off assets etc
* **From financing activities** = shares, loans, dividends
