I've kept this separate to the other parts so that you don't have to install them every time you want to run the scraper itself.\n","\n","The second code block uses those functions to scrape a number of pages linked by 'next' buttons. To do this it creates some special custom functions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tMzu4kaWdRbJ"},"source":["## Defining your own custom functions \n","\n","Often in scraping we will need to run the same block of code over and over again. In this situation it is useful to store that code in a function of its own that we can call when we want to re-use it.\n","\n","To create a custom function in Python you use the command `def` followed by the name you want to give your function. You then need some parentheses containing the names you want to give its ingredients (the parameters). \n","\n","Finally, you need to add a **colon**.\n","\n","For example: `def dosomething(withthis):`\n","\n","When you press enter the next line will be indented and any indented lines that follow will be stored within the function.\n","\n","However, the code inside the function will not run *until the function is called*.\n","\n","You call the function as you do any other. For example, to call the `dosomething` function used as an example above, you would simply type something like:\n","\n","`dosomething(putyourspecificthinghere)`\n","\n","This will take the variable `putyourspecificthinghere` and **pass** it to that function (as its one ingredient). Within the function this is assigned to a new **local variable** (called `withthis` in the example above) which only exists while that function is running."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w-8wIWdvf3Mh"},"source":["## Functions that `return` information\n","\n","Because information within a function only exists while it is running, some functions pass information *back* so that it can be stored.\n","\n","This is normally done through a `return()` command. Here's an example:\n","\n","```python\n","def addup(num1, num2):\n","  total = num1+num2\n","  return(total)\n","\n","gettingaresult = addup(5,10)\n","```\n","\n","In the example above a function is defined which **returns** the total of the two numbers it is supplied with (\"passed\"). \n","\n","When the function is run, with the numbers 5 and 10, it is run as part of a line creating a new variable, so the result returned is stored in that variable."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"sE2vW-IX9kYX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647287281227,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":218,"user":{"displayName":"Paul
