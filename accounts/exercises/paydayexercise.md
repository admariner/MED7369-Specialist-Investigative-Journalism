# Exercise: the return of payday loans

In April 2018 The Guardian reported on a "[new breed of payday lenders](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/14/wonga-mark-2-new-breed-of-payday-lenders-oakam) ... offering 'medium-term' loans at hefty APRs of up to 1,421%".

The article lists a number of names in the sector whose interest rates it had surveyed:

* Oakam - typical APR is 1,421%.
* PiggyBank has a typical APR of 1,270%, 
* Mr Lender 1,244.2%, 
* Trusted Quid 1,212.95%, 
* Lending Stream 1,325%, 
* Wonga 1,086%

The list provides a useful opportunity to revisit a story done back in 2013 when the first wave of payday lenders came on the scene: *[Payday loans companies charging up to 7,000% experience huge growth](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2013-09-05/payday-loans-companies-charging-up-to-7-000-experience-huge-growth)*:

> "Controversial payday loans companies, some charging interest rates as high as 7,000%, have experienced phenomenal growth since the start of the recession.

> "New research by the Bureau, which analysed dozens of company accounts and websites, found a rush of companies into the industry. At least 24 new ventures have been launched in the high cost credit sector since 2008, some operating several different trading companies and many offering short-term payday-style loans.

> "But far from feeling squeezed by the increased competition, all but one of the ten largest lenders specifically offering payday loans saw their turnover more than double in just three years – with one lender growing 42 times.

> "Together, the ten biggest payday lending companies had a total turnover of nearly £800m. Just three years ago these companies had a combined turnover of just £313m. And at the start of the recession only one company had turnover of more than £50m, now there are four companies with turnovers substantially over £100m."

The method was simple: look at each set of accounts and compile a spreadsheet based on the numbers. 

And that's what I'd like you to do with the new wave of lenders:

* Create a shared Google spreadsheet to input the data. It will need a column for the company, the date that the accounts are for (you can extract the year later), their revenue that year, and the name of the person inputting the data. You can add other columns, too, if you want to pursue angles such as how much profit they are making, how much tax they are paying and so on.
* Pick a company each
* Try to find that company on [Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/). It may be that the company name is different, so if you can't find it, check their website and other media for clues.
* Check the Nature of business (SIC) section at the bottom of the *Overview* page: it should say something like *64921 - Credit granting by non-deposit taking finance houses and other specialist consumer credit grantors*. 
* Go to Filing History and find the latest **Full accounts**
* The first thing to look at is normally on the last page of accounts: *parent company* or *ultimate controlling party*. This might tell you that you need to look at another company. For example, in the accounts for Oakam Limited it says that the intermediate parent company is Oakam Holdings Limited, and the ultimate controlling party is CS Capital Partners III L.P - it might be that those companies provide more clues, and you may want to add those to the spreadsheet too (with an extra column for 'parent company' or 'child company'). If there isn't much money moving through the accounts you're looking at, it might be that the money is going through the parent company instead.
* Now fill in the spreadsheet with the details you need
* Once you've finished with the accounts, go back to the webpage and look at the directors tab - you might find connections with other companies. For example the Director of Oakam is also the director of other lending companies, and CS Capital Partners companies.

After you've done a handful of companies stop to review what you've got so far. What story might you tell?

Consider doing a network diagram to show relationships between different companies and people. [Here's one by Mike Smith](https://kumu.io/mikesjourno/payday-loan#map-ZrX2J1J0/elem-mn6UgZxY)
