In November 2020 The Guardian reported on the "[Huge wealth of Rishi Sunak's family not declared in ministerial register](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/27/huge-wealth-of-sunaks-family-not-declared-in-ministerial-register)".

Many story ideas come from reading stories like this and thinking how you can replicate or adapt it (the [SCAMPER method](https://www.designorate.com/a-guide-to-the-scamper-technique-for-creative-thinking/) can help you come up with these ideas, e.g. *substitute* a different minister for Sunak, or *combine* this approach with others).

In this workshop you'll work as a team to map the relatives of ministers and what directorships they hold.
