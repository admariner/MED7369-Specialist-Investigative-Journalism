# Libel and privacy laws - Justin Walford, The Sun

**Robin Kelly** head of editorial compliance at The Sun. Pre-publication advice and also dealing with complaints under the IPSO code.

**Slander** is technically non permanent form (could be by gesture) - you have to prove damage/loss.

**Libel** is permanent. Broadcast, a play, online is libel. Don't need to prove loss, but *Defamation Act 2013 Section 1* added an important protection relating to companies that trade for profit: sets up a **Serious Harm Test**. A publication is not defamatory unless it passes that test: has to be likely to cause, or has caused, serious harm, not defined. Audience is a factor in that: a small audience minimises the harm compared to a larger one.

"What does the article mean?" Based on a reasonable understanding by an ordinary person.

**Statute of Limitations** (the period within which the person has to sue) is **1 year**.

Example:

> "What expensive habit can he not support on an income of Â£33,000? I'm sure Lord X himself would snort at suggestions that he was born with a silver spoon round his neck."

* Is it defamatory (would cause people to think badly of the person)?
* Is there a serious harm that could come about?

If yes, need a defence:

* Honest opinion
* Truth (substantially true)
* **Section 4** (Reynolds case) public interest defence: normally relied on when it turns out to be wrong, but 1) doing it was in the public interest, and 2) it was done appropriately (research, who was contacted, how it was written, right of response sought for *all* allegations, response *considered* in terms of potentially changing the article) - need a trail of evidence, keep notes and records, etc: they will look at notebooks etc.

Look at what you've written and ask "What do I mean? Is it clear?" This applies to notes, too - must match what was reported.

**Accuracy**: you can say someone is a nurse when they're a doctor and it's not libellous. But could complain under IPSO regulations. It's not just that it's true but you can *prove* that it's true. If you want to protect the identity of the source that's not enough.

## Privacy

Cliff Richard sued under privacy: BBC felt it was accurately reporting a raid on his house, and on libel they were merely recording the fact that police were raiding (not that he was guilty).

**European Convention of Human Rights Article 8** Right to respect for private and family life is said to have been used more than any other clause.

Privacy could be about finances, health, correspondence, relationships and sex, etc.

Once you go to a person for reaction on a story (for libel purposes) they may seek to get an injunction to prevent publication. It's difficult to get under defamation, but courts have been willing to grant if privacy is an issue. Burden then is on you to prove a public interest, they must then prove that they would win at trial.

Privacy: **Statute of Limitations** (the period within which the person has to sue) is **6 years**.

IPSO: The way you obtained material is important, may be an intrusion into privacy.

A wedding is not private (it's a matter of public record), photographs will usually be shared widely. But in one example a couple booked out the hotel grounds (not just a function room) and an agency photographer had stood at a boundary with a ladder and long lens camera, they had a reasonable expectation there would be no photographer. The pictures were not private but obtained in such a way that it was an intrusion into privacy.

Walking along the street is not private, but what is being photographed is important: Naomi Campbell photographed coming out of a rehab clinic, upheld as invasion of privacy.

Paraphrasing messages is typically seen as less intrusive than quoting verbatim from correspondence.

**IPSO Clause 10** covers **clandestine recording** which is generally disallowed unless there's a public interest, shown in writing. Has to be approved internally. Document says what they plan to do, why it cannot be obtained openly, the specific public interest being achieved. You may obtain *different* material which is also in the public interest, but you have to consider *again* is the way I achieved it *proportionate*.

**Data Protection Act**: there is an exemption for public interest journalism. But more broadly information that you hold on people you must keep secure.

## Law of confidence

Where a person is acting under a duty of confidence with regard to information then if they pass that information to a third party then that is potentially a breach of confidence.

Can be confidential within the organisation (e.g. colleague), or confidential to a third party (e.g. client).

Breach of confidence: **Statute of Limitations** (the period within which the person has to sue) is **6 years**.

Organisation can apply to court for you to reveal your sources. You will need to defend.

**PACE Act Section 10** protects sources but can be overruled in various situations including "in the interests of justice", so if Bribery Act in play then could be forced to reveal.

## Other legal considerations

* Bribery Act - important new law to consider when you are considering payment of a source

If it's in the public interest to pay then that is covered in the Act.

If documents are stolen, you may be handling stolen goods.
