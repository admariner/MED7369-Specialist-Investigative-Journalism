# Case study: Bolton Council of Mosques

[Concerns have been raised over the amount of money given by Bolton Council to Bolton Council of Mosques](https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17509746.special-report-the-truth-about-how-faith-groups-are-funded-by-bolton-council/) (BCoM). What can we find out?

[The website for BCoM](https://www.thebcom.org/) isn't very helpful: it doesn't mention any company number or charity number.

Even the ['Our staff' page](https://www.thebcom.org/our-staff) doesn't provide a name for the chief officer, which we could use to search Companies House.

And an [advanced search on OpenCorporates for companies registered at the same address of BL3 5LE](https://opencorporates.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=BL3+5LE&commit=Go&jurisdiction_code=&utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Go&controller=searches&action=search_companies&mode=best_fields&search_fields%5B%5D=registered_address_in_full&branch=&nonprofit=&order=) brings up two unrelated, and inactive, companies.

But a [search on Companies House for Bolton Council of Mosques](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/search?q=bolton+council+of+mosques) does bring up some results, including both [a company](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11052144/filing-history) and [a charity](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/CE017086).

A [search of the Charity Commission database](https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/?searchText=bolton%20council%20of%20mosques&pageNumber=1) helps us [find the charity's page](https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regId=1114004&subId=0). This includes financials, documents and trustees.

[The accounts for the year to June 2018](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends04/0001114004_AC_20180331_E_C.PDF) show an overview of income from charitable activities, and expenditure.

Further pages (notes to the accounts) show a breakdown of where that income came from, and what it was spent on.

For example, note 8 says that £78,000 was spent on staff, and that there were 12 employees.

Note 5 says that £12,725 was spent on ACWY vaccinations. A quick google tells us this is a jab which is widely available on the NHS, so why are they spending this?

Note 4 may give us a clue. This says that they received *income* of £15,865 for the same vaccinations. So actually they are *making money* on those vaccinations. This could be because they are being funded to provide the vaccinations (e.g. by the NHS, in order to reach hard-to-reach groups), or it could be because they are charging people directly, or it could be some other reason. Phonecalls would be needed to find out (not just to the MCoM, but to other organisations to check their version).

## Searching around

What else can we find out about this organisation? Well, some FOI requests have been made for details of payments to BCoM, including [this one](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/bolton_council_of_mosques_bcom) which was refused as a vexatious request, as part of a number of requests which have been calculated to be over the cost limit in aggregate. The account has also been suspended by WhatDoTheyKnow.

It may be worth submitting a similar (but better phrased) request which would be treated differently (because you are not submitting multiple other requests, and would be considered vexatious).

Before you do that, see what data is available through the [open data on expenditure above £500](https://www.bolton.gov.uk/downloads/download/196/expenditure_reports).

This also gives the cost centre and service area for each piece of spending with those organisations, so you can get a breakdown of what the money is used for.

We can also get a sense of the religious breakdown in Bolton through [research undertaken by the council](https://www.bolton.gov.uk/downloads/file/622/people-in-bolton-2011-census-religion-factfile) and the ONS data that it uses.

You can get an idea of the numbers of churches and mosques and other religious buildings in Bolton by looking at a dataset like [Places of worship registered for marriage](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/places-of-worship-registered-for-marriage) (that link was found by searching for numbers of mosques in the UK and coming across [this FOI request](https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/number_of_registered_mosques_in) which was declined on the basis that the data was already publicly available at that link).

For data on religious belief and church/mosque attendance you might look at a data source like the [British Social Attitudes surveys](http://www.britsocat.com/)
