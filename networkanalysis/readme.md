# Network analysis

This folder contains resources for doing a network analysis. Network analysis can be useful both in planning investigations (mapping networks and identifying actors within that) and storytelling (showing patterns or allowing users to explore networks).

[This post provides an introduction to network analysis for journalists](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/06/08/a-journalists-introduction-to-network-analysis/).

## Exercise: manual network analysis using Kumu

[Kumu.io](https://kumu.io/) is a tool for creating network graphs and similar data visualisation. These can be generated from datasets, or created manually. 

Once created, data can also be exported, which is a good way of getting used to how network analysis is typically structured. This time the data is split across two separate datasets, which are then combined in analysis. Those datasets are *entities* and *relationships*:

You can [find an exercise on getting started with Kumu in this folder](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/networkanalysis/kumuexercise.md).

[This post on Empathy as an investigative tool: how to map systems to come up with story ideas](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2020/02/19/empathy-investigative-journalism-story-ideas/) covers the same techniques.

## Customising a network diagram in Kumu: tutorial

I've also [put together a tutorial explaining how to colour code elements in Kumu, and also how to analyse it to identify numbers of connections](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTQVZsPzYX0u-FtCrpWpO7G8nCO35UMoZuQX-T4x7m5P633IV7D28ThsFVg2ptkVvztoaJVcpR8Hd2G/pub)

[This example adds sizing](https://embed.kumu.io/9d61cc335f508ac6a929793ceff3669a#import) (but doesn't have colour)

## Exercise: mapping the TaxPayers' Alliance network 

[This exercise uses the TaxPayers' Alliance to explore network analysis techniques](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/networkanalysis/taxpayersalliance.md).

## Using NodeXL to do network analysis in Excel

The [nodexl folder in this repo](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/networkanalysis/nodexl) contains resources on using NodeXL for network analysis.

## Using Gephi to do network analysis

The [gephi folder in this repo](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/tree/master/networkanalysis/gephi) contains resources on using Gephi for network analysis.

## Advanced network analysis: neo4j and the Panama Papers

The Panama Papers investigation used the powerful tool **neo4j** to analyse relationships. If you're interested in that particular dataset, or neo4j more generally, I've written some [notes on using the Panama Papers database with neo4j here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/networkanalysis/neo4j.md)

## Links and other resources

You can find [my bookmarks on various things related to network analysis here](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:networkanalysis). 

Add extra tags to drill down further, e.g. [https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:networkanalysis+tools](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:networkanalysis+tools) shows tools that I have bookmarked.

There is a [free book online about social network analysis methods](https://faculty.ucr.edu/~hanneman/nettext/),

Another cookbook [covers network analysis using R](http://sachaepskamp.com/files/Cookbook.html)
