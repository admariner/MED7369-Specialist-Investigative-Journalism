# Exercise: what do charities do with your money?

Charities are a good subject for practising your company account techniques for two reasons: 
* They receive public money, either through donations or, increasingly, in the form of funding from public bodies to deliver some aspect of public service
* There's extra information available about them via the Charities Commission and sometimes other sources (such as FOIs to those public bodies)

You might feel a little uneasy about investigating charities but that's precisely why some people use them as a way of avoiding scrutiny: there are many stories of unscrupulous characters abusing the charities system, so it's important to hold the system to account in order to prevent those things happening.

## First, pick a focus

There are hundreds of charities so we need to narrow the focus. It could be charities related to a particular health issue (e.g. cancer charities), or other issue (e.g. children's charities, animal charities); a geographical focus (charities based in, or operating in, a particular area); or a personal focus (those connected with a particular individual , or type of individual, such as politicians or celebrities).

Helpfully, the Charity Commission [search engine](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search) has an [advanced search facility](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search?p_p_id=uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet&p_p_lifecycle=0&p_p_state=normal&p_p_mode=view&_uk_gov_ccew_portlet_CharitySearchPortlet_mvcRenderCommandName=%2Fadvanced-search).

This includes a *Classifications* section where you can select, for example, **Animals**. By ticking that and leaving the search box empty, then clicking **Search**, you will [get all the charities classified under that category](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/results/page/1/delta/20).

You can then [sort those results to bring the biggest ones to the top](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/results/page/1/delta/20/sorted-by/charity-income/desc) by clicking on the **Income** heading. This should show the RSPB, RSPCA and People's Dispensary for Sick Animals making up the top three.

You now have a list of the top 10, 20 or more charities to focus your reporting on.

[Here's a list of the top 20 environmental charities, for example](https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/results/page/1/delta/20/sorted-by/charity-income/desc).

## Now pick an angle

Decide what you're interested in about these charities. Here are just a few angles:

* What are animal charities most concerned about? (From reading the statements at the front)
* Which charities have the highest paid directors? 
* Which charities are making more money, and which are making less, than before?
* Which charities are giving the largest proportion of their income to charitable activities? (And which are spending more of it on fundraising, or wages, or other outgoings)
* How has charity fundraising changed over the last few years? (Sources of income - for example the shift from donations to public funding)
* Which charities are most at risk of closing? (For example where their liabilities may be larger than their assets)

There are many others - look at news stories about charities' finances to get ideas.

## Design a spreadsheet to structure your information

The angle should determine the information that you will need from each annual report. You will need a way to collect and organise that - a spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet should have the following columns:

* Charity number (this will help in matching up data later)
* Charity name
* Year of accounts (or date) - you will need a different row for each different year's data
* Notes (this is where you can add any observations or thoughts that you need to come back to for a particular line of information)

Depending on the angle, you then might have a column for each different piece of information you want to store, e.g. turnover, or operating costs, or assets, or liabilities, or highest paid director's pay, etc.

Try to be specific with language so you know exactly what you're looking for - e.g. is it gross profit, or operating profit, or net profit? 

Make sure you enter information consistently: are you typing the full amount, or just 'in thousands of pounds'? (The full amount is generally best)

If you are dealing with numbers make sure you type ONLY numbers - NOT combinations of numbers and text like "almost £10m" or "says £10m but it's not clear". Use the notes column to add any text commentary you need.

Consider what you're going to need to do with the data, e.g. calculate a difference? Sort from largest to smallest? It will need to be stored in a way that makes that possible (i.e. stored as numbers, not text)

## Collect the information

You now need to check each charity's annual accounts to get the information you're collecting. You could type each name into the Companies House or Charity Commission search engine - but if you have their charity numbers then sometimes you can generate the URLs more quickly by putting them in the right place in a particular URL, e.g. 

The charity number for the RSPB is 207076 - you can get the returns by just putting it in the URL in the place where it appears below:

`https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/207076/accounts-and-annual-returns`

## Perform the analysis

Once you have all the data you can then analyse it. For example:

* Sorting to bring the largest or smallest numbers to the top
* Calculating a percentage (one number divided by another)
* Calculating a change from one year to the next (pivot tables can be useful for this, with a column for each year)

## Do background research and plan extra newsgathering

With that analysis done, you now know who the focus of your story is, which should lead to further background research and any interviews you need to do to find out more about the "why" behind what you've found.
