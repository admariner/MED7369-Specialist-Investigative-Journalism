# Exercise: mapping the TaxPayers' Alliance network

The TaxPayers' Alliance is a good organisation to explore. Despite [describing itself](https://www.taxpayersalliance.com/) as a "grassroots campaign for lower taxes, government transparency and an end to wasteful government spending" it has connections in high places. The organisation DeSmog notes that:

> "In 2018 the Guardian revealed that the group's US-based fundraising arm had provided it with at least $286,000 from unknown donors between 2013 and 2016. $100,000 of funding had come from a “billionaire-founded religious trust incorporated in the Bahamas”.
>
> "In 2009, a Guardian investigation found that the Midlands Industrial Council, a longstanding group of wealthy, Brexit-supporting Conservative Party donors, had donated around £80,000 to the group. The MIC currently includes Lord Bamford, chair of JCB, and Lord Edmiston, chair of the car importer International Motors.
>
> "Other donors include Malcolm McAlpine, director of the construction giant Sir Robert McAlpine, and David Alberto, who founded the serviced offices company Avanta and provides the group with office space on Tufton Street."

They are connected with Vote Leave - but how?

## Places to look

* See [who is a director on Companies House](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04873888/officers) - what other interests do they have? [Matthew Elliott](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/V7jPYukQs9HqUXHGPumtBaZrjMQ/appointments) is connected with some interesting organisations, for example.
* Note his date of birth (Feb 1978) and [search for his name](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/search?q=Matthew+Jim+ELLIOTT) to see if he's listed under other entries - those might be [at the same address with a different date of birth](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/2gyhDTt092sSekIBz84AU7G5Em4/appointments), or [vice versa](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/geE_qAiNIYucd38tOrHFw8LT1ak/appointments) for example
* Look in [the accounts](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04873888/filing-history) to find any information about disclosure of financing, related companies, transactions etc.
* Use OpenCorporates' advanced search facility to search by address [(55 Tufton Street)](https://opencorporates.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=55+tufton+street&commit=Go&jurisdiction_code=&utf8=%E2%9C%93&commit=Go&controller=searches&action=search_companies&mode=best_fields&search_fields%5B%5D=name&search_fields%5B%5D=previous_names&search_fields%5B%5D=company_number&search_fields%5B%5D=other_company_numbers&search_fields%5B%5D=registered_address_in_full&branch=&nonprofit=&order=) to see any other organisations there. These may or may not be connected in any other way, but represent potential avenues of inquiry. You'll need to create a free account to use this facility.
* Many of the organisations connected to TaxPayers' Alliance are political - use [the Electoral Commission's databases](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/?currentPage=0&rows=10&sort=AcceptedDate&order=desc&tab=1&et=pp&et=ppm&et=tp&et=perpar&et=rd&isIrishSourceYes=true&isIrishSourceNo=true&prePoll=false&postPoll=true&register=gb&register=ni&register=none&optCols=Register&optCols=CampaigningName&optCols=AccountingUnitsAsCentralParty&optCols=IsSponsorship&optCols=IsIrishSource&optCols=RegulatedDoneeType&optCols=CompanyRegistrationNumber&optCols=Postcode&optCols=NatureOfDonation&optCols=PurposeOfVisit&optCols=DonationAction&optCols=ReportedDate&optCols=IsReportedPrePoll&optCols=ReportingPeriodName&optCols=IsBequest&optCols=IsAggregation) to search for donations, expenditure etc.
* Use Nexus to do a cuttings search on the people involved (this is more effective than searching for the organisation TaxPayers Alliance as they are widely quoted in other stories which makes it difficult to drill down to stories about them)
* Scrape their tweets to see who they tweet at; what hashtags they use; repeat the process for their followers and followed
