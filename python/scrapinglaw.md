# Notes on scraping law

In [this video a panel discusses the range of legal issues that scraping raises](https://www.bigmarker.com/oxylabs/web-scraping-legal-perspective?bmid=1b64733cb114). Here are some key notes:

Sanaea Daruwalla from 15 mins, notes that you need to consider:

* What you're scraping
* How you're scraping
* What you're doing with that

The top 3 things are:

* Copyright issues
* Contract laws and how they relate to T&Cs, factors such as [Browsewrap Versus Clickwrap](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/difference-browsewrap-clickwrap), whether it's public or non-public data
* Personal data: make sure you know what personal data is, and what laws you might run into (GDPR, CDPA)

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the US - supposed to be an anti-hacking law, is another.

Allen Oâ€™Neil at 22 mins:

Database Copyright Law says that if we have a database then we have copyright in it. But if it's just a listing of something that happens then copyright doesn't apply. On the other hand if I add value to it then I can. The question is to what extent you can argue that you've added value, in a similar way to how patent law operates and differs in application between the EU and US.

Steven Callahan:



## Notes

[Browsewrap Versus Clickwrap](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/difference-browsewrap-clickwrap):

> "A browsewrap agreement is when you place links to your legal agreements somewhere on your website (usually at the bottom) ... A clickwrap agreement, on the other hand, is when you require users to actively give consent, such as by checking a box to confirm that they have read and agree to the terms of your agreements, or clicking an "Accept" button next to a statement that informs the user that by clicking, they are accepting the terms.
