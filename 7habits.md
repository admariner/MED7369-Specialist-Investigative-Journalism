# The 7 habits of successful journalists

You will often hear journalists talk about the personal qualities of good reporters - things like stubbornness or scepticism - that employers look for when hiring. Sometimes they will say that these things are 'innate' or "can't be taught". This is rubbish. Over the years I've thought about these qualities a lot, and how to develop them in students.

Here, then, is a list of 7 habits that I believe the best journalism demonstrates, and good journalists develop. These are not 'personal qualities' that "cannot be taught": those that promote this view of journalism are, I believe, either demonstrating arrogance in saying so, or laziness in failing to see that these qualities can, and are, taught around the world outside of journalism education.

The first 4 habits relate primarily to newsgathering: they are qualities that help journalists to see stories where others do not, to collect the information required, and treat it appropriately.

The other 3 habits relate more to the communication of the resulting stories: ensuring that the right story is told in the most effective way, or ways.

You may disagree with this list, or have other qualities that you think need adding. I'd love to hear those.

## 1. Curiosity - and imagination

*"Don't say you want to see the world and then complain if you're sent to Djibouti."*

One of the greatest appeals of journalism - the fact that you might be reporting on one thing today and a completely different thing tomorrow - is also sometimes the source of students' most common complaint: that a subject is not interesting.

The complaint is a symptom of bad habits: a symptom, specifically, of a lack of *curiosity*.

Good journalism starts with curiosity: a desire to learn about the world, to ask questions about how it works. It is also a result of an attempt to *imagine* what the results might be.

But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

Why is good journalism a result of curiosity? (Well done if you were asking that question: it shows you're already developing good habits!)

You can classify journalism into two broad categories: stories that *react* to events; and stories that *proactively* reveal or shine a spotlight on things that we need to know.

The second category of stories has its seed in curiosity: proactive journalism cannot exist without curiosity; it begins with a question: "What happens to sportspeople after they retire?"; "What is the council spending its money on?"; "Why don't we have a cure for cancer?"

But reactive reporting would also be much poorer if we were not curious, too.

Take a standard story: a car crash. This might begin with a statement from the local police force that a car crashed on a particular road at 11.15pm and the driver has been arrested.

An incurious reporter might simply publish those facts, and nothing else. There is a term for this process: **churnalism**: journalism which adds nothing, questions nothing, and merely republishes the information that has been provided from one source.

A curious reporter, however, would want to know more:

* What type of car was it?
* How did it crash? Did it leave the road, was it a collision with another car, or with some other obstacle?
* Why did it crash? Did the driver fall asleep? Were they distracted? Were they under the influence of alcohol or another substance? Was it someone else's fault? A problem with the road?
* Who was in the car? Was it just the driver?
* Was anybody else involved, either as participants or witnesses?
* Is the driver hurt? Anyone else?
* What has the driver been arrested for?
* Have they been charged? Released? When will the police need to decide one way or another?
* Is it rare or common for crashes to happen on this road?
* Where on the road did it take place?

You will notice that many of these questions fall into the '5 Ws and a H' often discussed in journalism:

* What?
* Who?
* Where?
* When?
* Why?
* How?

### Methods to develop curiosity

In fact the '5 Ws and a H' approach is a *method* to develop a habit of curiosity. Journalists starting out in their careers will list these questions and try to answer them in their reporting. More experienced journalists might do so without thinking: it has become a habit.

But there are other methods too: consider the role of **imagination** in the process above. The police have provided very little information, but we are already *imagining* parts of the story as a result. We might, for example, be already imagining that the driver was drunk. Why? Because the police have arrested the driver: we *assume* (imagine) that this means they believe that the driver has broken a law. Furthermore, we *imagine* that the most likely law in this context is going to be the one regarding drunk driving.

Reading such clues is useful, and important: it helps triggers the questions we might ask - but it can also be dangerous, and limiting. Not because imagination is bad, but because of a *failure of imagination*.

Consider the following other explanations for why the driver has been arrested:

* He was under the influence of drugs, not drink
* He wasn't wearing a seatbelt
* The car wasn't fit for the road
* He assaulted officers
* He was wanted for another, unrelated, crime

Here's another failure of imagination: the bullet points above all used the word 'he'. Where did police say that this person was a *man*? Nowhere.

The more information provided, the more that our imagination will have to work with - but also the more limited. A particular make of car might lead us to make more assumptions about the events. What if the car was a black Porsche? A brown family saloon? A pink Volkswagen Beetle? A white VW Golf?

Curiosity and imagination help us to start asking questions - but there's a further habit we need to develop when listening to the answers...

## 2. Scepticism

https://twitter.com/Will_deF/status/1113107244835631104

When reporting a news event, do we only report what people tell us? What if two different sources say contrasting things?

Scepticism is important in journalism because it moves us from merely repeating what people have said, to establishing the *factual basis* for that information. It has become particularly important in a modern information age when most public bodies can communicate with the public directly, without that accountability.

If curiosity is where journalists act as the eyes and ears of the audience, scepticism is where *we act as the mouth of the audience*: it is the way in which we give a voice to an audience which isn't able to ask questions itself.

Scepticism is also another example of the journalist exercising their *imagination*: the sceptical journalist must always ask "But what if this information is not true?" - *what if*?

Asking "What if?" is a simple exercise to get trainee journalists to challenge the version of events they are being presented with. 'What if they are lying?'; 'What if they didn't witness it directly?'; 'What if they misunderstood?'; 'What if they misheard?'; 'What if they have a reason to omit key information?' and so on.

It is important to distinguish scepticism from *cynicism*: the cynic *assumes* that they are being lied to; it is another *failure of imagination*, a failure to imagine that they are not being lied to. It is just as lazy as being credulous, where the person fails to imagine the opposite: that they are not being told the truth.

The sceptic, by contrast, is *comfortable with (but not accepting of) the uncertainty* of not knowing whether something is true or false. It is a difficult position for the journalist to occupy, because uncertainty is not welcomed in the newsroom or in the news report: we deal with facts.

How, then, does the newsroom handle uncertainty? Mainly with **attribution**: "police said"; "the MP for Rochdale said"; "a witness said". With no time to establish the veracity of these accounts, and a deadline looming, we can only report what was *said*, not what *happened*.

This is an important distinction to make, and one that trainee journalists learn: do not report what someone has said as fact, if you cannot establish it yourself.

### Methods for developing scepticism

Listing the facts in a story, and then attributing each of those, is a useful exercise for developing this skill. It turns each fact into a *claim*. The journalist then has to explicitly decide whether to:

a) Report it as a widely accepted or acknowledged fact whose source has no relevance to the story;
b) Attribute the statement to allow the audience to make a decision as to its trustworthiness, including any relevant information that may inform that decision (for example, the person has a vested interest);
c) Perform some additional checks to establish what basis there is for the claim (this includes a 'what if' exercise to explore reasons for the claim not being accurate);
d) Omit the claim from the report

Establishing facts is not an exact science: in the example above the report might say that 'Police have arrested a man following a crash on Chester Road' even though they have not observed the crash themselves, or seen the man in question or his arrest. They would do so because they have no reason to believe the police would mislead them over such an innocuous event.

However, when dealing with other parts of the story, particularly those which may be subject to some debate in future, they might be more cautious: 'Police say the vehicle was travelling at over 50mph when it collided with another vehicle'. How do they know the vehicle was travelling that fast, or that it collided?

Scepticism allows us to make these decisions, but on its own it is not enough for great journalism: we must be able to pursue the facts that will allow us to better establish what the facts actually are; to move from 'not knowing' to 'knowing'. And that requires persistence...

## 3. Persistence/tenacity

One of the earliest skills that broadcast journalists learn is how to conduct a *vox pop*. Short for *vox populi* (voice of the people) the vox pop is an attempt to 'take the pulse' of the public on a topical issue: the journalist will stand in a busy public place and ask passers-by to share their pearls of wisdom on the issue of the day.

The results will typically be used as part of a news package (not, it should be pointed out, on their own), particularly when the news story in question doesn't have many other interviews or visuals to draw on. Most are quickly forgotten (the exception, perhaps the best known example of the form, is [Brenda from Bristol's reaction to the announcement of the 2017 snap general election](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6-IQAdFU3w): "You're joking - not ANOTHER ONE!")

Try it yourself: stand on a street corner with a microphone and an audio recorder, and ask people if they are prepared to be interviewed about a topical issue.

Most will refuse.

And this is the point. Failure is part of journalism. When you try to speak to people, many will refuse to speak to you, or ignore you entirely, and it is helpful to accept this from the start, and to see it for what it is: *it is not failure; it is part of the job*. Put another way, most of the time our job is not to get a response from everyone, but to *find the people who are willing to speak*.

I start with vox pops because we seem to find it easier to accept failure when trying to grab passers-by than we do when cold-calling or approaching potential interviewees - but the principle is the same. And once you have developed a bit of a hard skin from doing vox pops, you may find it easier to be rejected or ignored when chasing more specific sources.

### What comes after failure

The difference, of course, is that when we're chasing interviewees failure is harder to deal with: we can't just pick *anyone* off the street: we need *that* organisation to respond to accusations being levelled at it; or *someone* who has experienced this issue to share their personal experience; or a real *expert* to help readers (and us) to understand the 'why' or 'how' something is happening.

Failure is also harder to recognise. Yes, we might be told 'no' outright, but our calls and emails might more often be simply ignored, or the person may promise to respond, but continually delay doing so. In these cases we also need the wisdom to recognise that we are failing, and to respond to that.

When it comes to finding a source willing to speak, we have two ways of dealing with failure:

* Find an alternative *source*, or:
* Find an alternative *approach*

At this point we are moving from **persistence** to **tenacity**. As [one source puts it](https://seths.blog/2013/11/tenacity-is-not-the-same-as-persistence/):

> "Persistence is doing something again and again until it works ... Tenacity is using new data to make new decisions to find new pathways to find new ways to achieve a goal when the old ways didn't work."

Finding alternative sources can include some creative lateral thinking (creativity being one of the other habits, explored below): how can you find other experts? Case studies? Other people whose response is relevant? Do you need to change the story to focus on a different sort of source?

A Reuters guide to [*Covering Trump the Reuters Way*](https://www.reuters.com/article/rpb-adlertrump/covering-trump-the-reuters-way-idUSKBN15F276) makes this advice explicit, in the context of an uncooperative White House:

> "If one door to information closes, open another one. Give up on hand-outs and worry less about official access. They were never all that valuable anyway. Our coverage of Iran has been outstanding, and we have virtually no official access. What we have are sources. Get out into the country and learn more about how people live, what they think, what helps and hurts them, and how the government and its actions appear to them, not to us."

In some cases, however, we don't have that choice, and we need to be more persistent with *one* source. This means being prepared to be a little bit annoying - remember it's not our job to be everyone's friend, and most sources will understand (and even respect) that it is our job not to give up easily when a response is important.

James B. Stewart explains this in his book *Follow The Story*:

> "Our natural tendency is not to be rude and, once rebuffed, to stop trying. But I myself have often found myself talking to reporters I had hoped to avoid, simply to get them to stop calling. Persistence is effective." (Stewart 1998 p98)

It is, of course, not always appropriate or ethical to be persistent. This is where alternative approaches involving **empathy** (see below) can be useful.

### Persistence in reporting

Beyond persistence with sources, persistence can also be a virtue in reporting on a particular story - or, more broadly, the issue that a series of stories touches on.

In 2016, for example, BuzzFeed [reported](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo#.hcRNEk6Ox) on a cottage industry of over 100 pro-Trump fake news websites "being run from a single town in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia." Craig Silverman and Lawrence Alexander wrote in the report:

> "The young Macedonians who run these sites say they don't care about Donald Trump. They are responding to straightforward economic incentives: As Facebook regularly reveals in earnings reports, a US Facebook user is worth about four times a user outside the US. The fraction-of-a-penny-per-click of US display advertising — a declining market for American publishers — goes a long way in Veles. Several teens and young men who run these sites told BuzzFeed News that they learned the best way to generate traffic is to get their politics stories to spread on Facebook — and the best way to generate shares on Facebook is to publish sensationalist and often false content that caters to Trump supporters."

And that, it seemed, was that. A great story - important, surprising, and revealing. A job well done. Now, what's next?

But the reporters weren't done. Two years later, they [returned to the story](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/american-conservatives-fake-news-macedonia-paris-wade-libert) (with new partners) to reveal there was more to it than first appeared:

> "[A]fter reviewing social media posts, government records, domain registry information, and archived versions of fake news sites, as well as interviewing key players, BuzzFeed News, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, and the Investigative Reporting Lab Macedonia can now reveal that Veles’ political news industry was not started spontaneously by apolitical teens.

> "Rather, it was launched by a well-known Macedonian media attorney, Trajche Arsov — who worked closely with two high-profile American partners for at least six months during a period that overlapped with Election Day."

Here is another example of persistence in practice: the Bureau of Investigative Journalism’s [Drone Warfare project](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/projects/drone-war) has been tracking US drone strikes for over 5 years. Its core [methodology](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/explainers/our-methodology), as [I wrote previously](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2015/10/13/giving-a-voice-to-the-voiceless-data-journalism-and-the-dead/), is persistence:

> "Bureau reporters monitor news reports, press releases and documents and over time have turned those 'free text' reports into a structured dataset that can be analysed, searched, and queried. That data — complemented by interviews with sources — has been used by NGOs and the Bureau has submitted written evidence to the UK’s Defence Committee."

It was persistence that came to mind for Private Eye's Ian Hislop, when asked to define investigative journalism by a UK inquiry panel looking into the future of investigative journalism. He [replied](http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/anthony-barnett/official-lying-in-uk-what-child-detention-reveals-about-how-we-are-govern) that it was "in part ... saying the same true thing again and again and again and again until the penny drops. It is not just that Private Eye runs a story, its influence comes from repeating it over and over again."

Like all of these qualities, persistence is something that can be learned. [This Freakonomics podcast](https://overcast.fm/+Nu9VaHJeM/12:02) sees the psychologist **Angela Duckworth** explain how.

## 4. Empathy

Empathy is the ability to imagine *what it is like to be in someone else's shoes*. It is perhaps one of the more underrated qualities of good journalists, perhaps because people often confuse it with *sympathy*.

The difference between the two is important: it is possible to think about what it is like to be a particular person (empathy), including criminals and corrupt officials, without feeling sorry for them (sympathy).

For example, an official may have given contracts to people she knew because she was worried about losing their friendship, or it was easier than going through a longer external process, or because she feared for her job and was hoping it might help her get employment if she lost it. These are all motivations we can understand, but we can still see that the resulting actions are immoral and unjustified.

Why do we need empathy as a journalist? Firstly, it helps us dig deeper into a story. Identifying the motivations involved in an event - part of the 'why' of a story - can help us better report it. If there is a systemic problem it helps identify what human dynamics that system needs to account for. If there is a human impact it helps us to explore and report that.

In other words, empathy is one aspect of **scepticism**: without empathy it can be easy for the journalist to revert to stereotype. The 'welfare cheat' and the 'corrupt politician', the 'illegal immigrant' and the 'fatcat boss', the 'apathetic youth' and the 'racist pensioner', the 'criminal' and the 'victim' are all cliches that we can push past - with just a little empathy-based scepticism.

Secondly, empathy can help us identify the best ways to approach sources, and to deal with them afterwards. Sources are likely to harbour at least some suspicion about your motives in approaching them - based, no doubt, on another cliche: the morality-free reporter who will twist what you say to fit a story that's already written in his mind. So how do we address that suspicion?

Empathy helps us to identify what those suspicions might be: the 'victim' is likely to have very different feelings about speaking to a journalist to the 'criminal'; academic experts may be operating in a different environment to police officers. Here is an example of empathising with each:

* A 'victim' might be worried about repercussions from the person or organisation he or she is a victim of, or concerned about increased media attention and the impact on his or her family
* A 'criminal' might be worried about being judged, or fear repercussions from others involved
* An academic expert might be too busy hitting a conference deadline or buried in end-of-term marking, or might receive dozens of enquiries every week, and does not see journalistic approaches as a priority. Or they might think journalists typically have only a superficial understanding of the issue and will make mistakes when trying to report it
* A police officer might have to refer all press enquiries to the press office, or have concerns about legal issues such as contempt

Many of these obstacles can be addressed by demonstrating in our approach that it is based on **curiosity**, not a prejudiced opinion. That we are seeking to **understand** what actually happened, and why.

Empathy might involve understanding that many people are not aware of the distinction between opinion (where judgement is often passed) and news reporting (where it is not) - and that we might need to explain that. We might equally need to explain that it is not our role to act as their advocate. We might explain our duty to provide a right of reply, or to give a voice to the voiceless, or to ask the 'why' questions relating to newsworthy events.

Other obstacles might be addressed by demonstrating our legal or field-specific knowledge, or our commitment to reporting on a particular field. We might point to previous work, or ask mutual contacts who have dealt with us in the past to act as a go-between and vouch for our integrity.

Finally, empathy can help us in finding individuals and information in the first place. If I was a twin and I was writing about my experiences online, what phrase would I use that non-twins would not? Answer: "My twin". If someone wants to hide information when might they do that? After they've been approached? So I might use a service which alerts me to changes on specific webpages, or differences between pages saved before and then downloaded again after the approach. If I was really in a particular place at a particular time what should I be able to describe that wasn't in reports? Perhaps the weather (which you can then research ahead of any meeting, ready to use as part of some verification processes).


## 5. Creativity

Describing journalism as a creative profession may engender a certain discomfort: we portray journalism as a neutral activity, a 'portrayal of facts' that is different to fiction or the arts that appear to 'create something from nothing'.

But journalism is absolutely a creative endeavour: we must choose where to point the camera (literally or metaphorically), how to frame the shot, where to cut and what to retain and discard, how to combine the results to tell a story succinctly, accurately and fairly (not always the story we set out to tell). We must use creativity to solve any problems that might prevent us getting the camera in that position in the first place. All of those are creative decisions.

And before all of that, we must come up with ideas for stories too. The journalist who relies entirely on press releases is rightly sneered at by peers; it is a sign of a lack of imagination to generate their own ideas about where to look for news leads, and how to pursue those.

Creativity - and a desire to express it - is [one of the main reasons that people choose to study journalism](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17512786.2019.1591929). The challenge for journalism educators and trainers, often, is how to transform that raw communicative impulse into something more than writing opinion pieces or video blogs. Something, actually, more *creative*.

First, then, it's important to separate those three forms of creativity:

* Creativity of story ideas
* Creativity in problem-solving (newsgathering and production)
* Creativity of expression (communication)


### Creativity of ideas

Creativity of ideas is perhaps the form most highly valued by employers. It is a regular (and age-old) complaint that job applicants may have technical skills, but no good story ideas.

Good story ideas typically come from wide and regular reading. People who don't read or listen to much news reporting are making things difficult for themselves in three ways: firstly, they are more likely to come up with basic ideas that are already being done; secondly, they have less raw material (inspiration) to work with; and thirdly, they are less likely to know *what a good idea looks like*.

For example, a common mistake that journalism students make when brainstorming story ideas is to suggest a *topic*, not a *story*: "I am going to write a story about climate change".

A good tip is to be as specific as possible, and return to those 5 Ws and a H to help:

* Who can you write a story about? Is there a specific person who is doing something newsworthy?
* Where might a story be taking place, or have taken place? Is there a location which is experiencing some sort of change - or will do - or has done and this has topical relevance?
* What is new, or surprising?
* When is something taking place? Is there an upcoming event you can report on?
* How can you report this story in a way that is interesting? Could you do your interview in an unusual way? Is there a first-person experience you could write about? ('A day in the life')
* Why would a particular story be newsworthy *now*? Why would it appeal to your audience?

The [SCAMPER method](https://www.post-it.com/3M/en_US/post-it/ideas/articles/scamper-method/) is another approach used to encourage creativity that [can be adapted to journalism](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/using-scamper-to-generate-article-ideas/). The acronym represents a list of 7 techniques:

* Substitute
* Combine
* Adapt
* Modify
* Put to another use
* Eliminate
* Reverse

So, for example, you might try some of the following:

* Find an article you like and **substitute an element** (e.g. same interview approach, different person). Or substitute the form (change an interview to a news article, or a report to a liveblog)
* **Combine two ideas** (e.g. do an FOI request *and* a first person story)
* **Adapt** an idea: what can be added to it? (more interviews, some data, a gallery?)
* **Modify** it: what can be changed? (the location? The timeframe?)
* Put an idea to **another use**: can you repeat a story from elsewhere in your local area, or field, or just update it?
* List the elements of your story and **eliminate** one or more to make it more focused
* Can you **reverse** the order of the story, or the elements being used?

Variety is important: a story from one field can inspire an approach in another; connections can be made across time and space.

### Creativity in problem-solving

Journalism often doesn't go to plan: an interview may be dull or an interviewee pull out, events may be cancelled or underwhelm, a dataset is limited, or fails to show the pattern we were expecting.

The difference between the journalist and the non-journalist is that *we still find a story to tell*.

When an event is cancelled, for example, a journalist has the problem-solving creativity to come up with a new idea. It might be to write a new story about why it was cancelled, or the challenges facing this particular event organiser, or events organisers more generally. Or there is a piece to be written about the cost of security for the event, or they forget about the event and go to their list of backup story ideas (always have one!)

When an interviewee pulls out we have to think creatively about ways to solve that problem: is there a way to persuade them to change their mind? Where can we find alternatives? How can we re-angle the story around a different interviewee and still use some of the material we've gathered?

Working through some of these scenarios is a useful exercise in developing the sort of resilience that editors want from reporters - although pretty much any live news day will generate these obstacles anyway, as students are often ignored by, or turned down by, potential interviewees.

### Creativity in expression

In terms of expression, creativity allows us to recreate and work with the forms of the news genre: to write a news report or record an interview feature. Like any form of expression, the first step is to look at lots of examples and learn the unwritten rules of those: the inverted pyramid, the fact-quote-colour rhythm of the feature.

And the current era offers perhaps the most creative scope of any in the history of journalism: reporters are no longer constrained by their primary platform (print, radio or TV) to one medium (words, audio or video). The addition of online as a platform has required reporters to creatively adapt to the challenges of multiple media and genres. Moreover, the creation and ongoing development of new genres - the blog, the liveblog, the interactive, the podcast, the datavis, the infographic, the tweet, the audio slideshow, the social video, the livestream, the 360 video, the VR experience, the Snapchat/Instagram story - means a journalist's creativity doesn't stop with the 'mastery' of one particular form: there is always another to explore.

There is a risk, however, that this leads to too big a focus on *technical* creativity - the skills of storytelling - at the expense of time spent on the other forms. Our liking of creativity can stray into **indulgence**: we may be tempted to use long words to show off our vocabulary, where in fact shorter simpler ones may be more effective and more easily understood by our audience; or we might use a new storytelling form such as VR just because we can rather than because it works best for the story. And that is where discipline comes in.

## 6. Discipline

A journalist operates within certain constraints that require a certain amount of self-control, or **discipline**. For example:

* They must consider the **audience** in their selection and treatment of stories
* They must hit regular **deadlines**
* They must write **within a particular word or character count**
* They must remain **impartial and objective** in their reporting (in most genres)

These aspects of discipline are reflected in some of the most common feedback given to student journalists:

* Avoid writing about things that interest yourself, or your peers - consider instead what your audience wants and needs to know
* Avoid assuming knowledge on the part of the audience that they may not have
* Stick to the 'house style'
* Resist the temptation to 'draw a conclusion' at the end of an article
* Resist the temptation to inject your thoughts into the article - keep yourself out of the story if possible
* Don't let the deadline pass without publishing something!

Discipline can sometimes be seen as creativity's killjoy, but this is a myth: there are [numerous books about the subject](https://medium.com/swlh/for-a-more-creative-brain-embrace-constraints-5a588c8a8619), and across creative education you will find exercises that involve putting limits on the creator to encourage creativity. Examples include [forcing an artist to draw with their weaker hand](http://reljadereta.com/drawing-with-your-weak-hand-for-a-month-a-practical-creativity-experiment/), or [working with a limited palette of colours](https://www.artistsnetwork.com/art-inspiration/creativity-exercises/).

In literature Georges Perec's *A Void* was the result of challenging himself to [write a novel without using the letter 'e'](http://www.odditycentral.com/art/a-void-the-famous-300-page-book-written-without-a-single-letter-e.html), and Geoff Ryman's book *253* is the result of the discipline of writing [253 words each, 253 times, for each passenger in a tube train](https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-18295-3). In music Talking Heads' '*This Must Be The Place (Naive Melody)’*' has a melody that resulted when [the band swapped instruments](https://theboar.org/2018/02/talking-heads-best-love-song/) as a creative exercise in writing the song.

Journalism's constraints are built-in, but can also be built on. We can be disciplined in attending every council meeting for a year, in checking in with a contact every month, in visiting a new place every week.

Discipline is also important in learning a skill: being disciplined enough to practise your skills regularly - create *more* than one package, write *more* than one article, interview *more* than one person - is how you get good at that skill. This is the difference between the aspiring journalism who wants to master their art, and the one who merely wants to pass their assessment or obtain a qualification.

 This is why regular blogging, vlogging, podcasting, coding, Instagramming, or posting on Twitter are all useful disciplines to develop - each develops a habit and a comfort with putting together words, audio, code, images or video. (You might file this under 'persistence', too)

**Attention to detail** is a key discipline: accuracy in language is crucial in journalism, while the stories in documents and data can often come from spotting crucial details.


## 7. Adaptability - Attention to detail - passion/conviction

## All 7 habits work in tension with each other

Now that these have been listed, it is important to remember how each works in tension with the other:

A good journalist is **curious**, but not *credulous*: their **scepticism** helps prevent this. But scepticism should be distinguished from *cynicism*: a sceptical journalist develops the habit of **persistence** in establishing whether something is true or not. Persistence is aided by **empathy** which helps you *imagine* the best places to look, and identify the best possible approach.

Equally, the **creative** reporter should not be *indulgent* with respect to that creativity; they need **discipline** to employ that creativity towards a journalistic objective, ensuring that their story is clear, coherent and appropriate to the target audience. But discipline does not mean *rigidity*: a modern journalist needs the **adaptability** to realise when the story they had in mind has changed, or that it needs to be told in a different way.
