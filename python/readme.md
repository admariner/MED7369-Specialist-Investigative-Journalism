# Python

As a student on the MA at Birmingham City University, you have access to a free copy of [Scraping for Journalists](https://leanpub.com/scrapingforjournalists). Look for the special link on Moodle - and read the first few chapters before continuing!

I have created a range of resources to get started with Python in a [dedicated repository here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonintro/). That includes:

* A [guide to getting used to basic programming concepts by using Google Colab](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/pythonFirstStepsColab.ipynb)
* An [example scraper in Google Colab using lists](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/anExampleScraperList.ipynb)
* An [example scraper written in a Colab Python notebook](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/anExampleScraper1page.ipynb)
* An [example scraper notebook which follows 'next' links from page to page](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/anExampleScraperNextPage.ipynb)

## Other notebooks

* Move on to [this guide to some lines of code you can use to interact with an API](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/executepythononline.md)
* Next, you can switch to Morph.io and [this guide to using it for scraping](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/1introtopython.ipynb) or [this guide to using it with an API](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo/blob/master/morphio.md)
* There's also a [guide to scraping a specific page (on auction listings)](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/python/scrapingauctions.md)
* I have some [more stuff on Python in another repo](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/python_demo)

## Python notebooks

One good to way to use Python on your computer - while also building the habit of making notes for yourself and for your audiences - is a Jupyter notebook.

* [Video tutorial: Installing Python and Jupyter Notebook](https://www.lynda.com/Software-Development-tutorials/Installing-Python-Jupyter-Notebook/576698/605448-4.html) (note you have free access to Lynda as a BCU student)
* A [guide to getting used to basic programming concepts by using Execute Python Online](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonintro/blob/master/execute_python_online.ipynb)
