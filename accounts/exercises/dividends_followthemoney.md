# Dividends: follow the money

A good exercise if you want to learn about company accounts is to reverse-engineer a story based on company accounts. Here's a particularly instructive example:

In June 2023 Private Eye reported: 

> "Surescreen Diagnostics Ltd [who were] given a £500m contract for lateral flow tests [during the Coronavirus pandemic] ... recorded profits for 2020/21 of £67m on a turnover of £151m, giving a 45 percent profit rate that would make other Covid profiteers blush (while having its accounting qualified for ropey record-keeping) ...
>
> "£90m was paid in dividends for the two years to parent company Sunscreen Holdings Ltd, owned by brothers Alastair, Alexandr and David Campbell. But instead of paying the brothers a healthy dividend each and being done with it, the Surescreen group last year underwent a series of corporate contortions to get the money out. First, a new holding company, Surescreen Diagnostics Holdings (2022) Ltd, was created. It then drastically reduced its share capital by around £62m, alongside some other corporate tweaks. The effect of reducing share capital, as opposed to paying a dividend, can be to convert what would be income taxable at higher rates into capital gains taxed at 20 percent."

## Finding the dividends

Let's start by finding those dividends.

Look at [the accounts for Surescreen Diagnostics Ltd](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03235601/filing-history) for the year ending 2022.

**Dividends** are listed in most accounts - this is an amount of money paid to shareholders. 

Normally dividends are detailed in one of the **Notes to the accounts** (or a similar phrase, in this case *Notes to the financial statements*). In the 21/22 accounts for Surescreen Diagnostics Ltd, it's note number 7, on page 13.

That note says that the company paid dividends of £36m in 2022 and £54.4m in 2021. So, a total of £90.4m in two years.

## Finding the shareholders

Now we need to work out where that £90m went. 

Once again, dividends are paid to shareholders. And we can find out who owns most of the shares in a company by using Companies House's ability to see **Persons with significant control**.

To find this, go to [the 'People' tab on the company's page](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03235601/officers) on Companies House. By default you'll be shown the *Officers* list. But next to this tab is a *'Persons with significant control'* tab](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03235601/persons-with-significant-control). Switch to that.

This lists entities that own a lot of shares, and in this case it says "1 active person with significant control": Surescreen Holdings Limited.

At the bottom it gives detail on the "Nature of control": in this case "Ownership of shares – 75% or more"

So we know that Surescreen Holdings Limited owns at least 75% of the shares. 

Usefully, the page also gives their registration number: 09067025. 

Now, for more information we can look for *that* company's accounts...

## Finding details about the shareholder

Search for Surescreen Holdings Limited on Companies House and you'll find it taking you to the URL https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09067025. Notice that the number at the end of that URL is the same as the registration number listed earlier: 09067025. That tells you it's the right company (you can also save time by simply pasting that number on the end of the basic URL).
