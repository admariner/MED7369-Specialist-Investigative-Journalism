In November 2020 The Guardian reported on the "[Huge wealth of Rishi Sunak's family not declared in ministerial register](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/27/huge-wealth-of-sunaks-family-not-declared-in-ministerial-register)".

Many story ideas come from reading stories like this and thinking how you can replicate or adapt it (the [SCAMPER method](https://www.designorate.com/a-guide-to-the-scamper-technique-for-creative-thinking/) can help you come up with these ideas, e.g. *substitute* a different minister for Sunak, or *combine* this approach with others).

In this workshop you'll work as a team to map the relatives of ministers and what directorships they hold.

## First decide your scope

With any investigation it's important to establish the scope of what you can do. When talking about politicians, for example, we might mean:

* All 650 MPs
* Current and former MPs
* Councillors
* Politicians within a particular party
* Ministers
* Cabinet ministers 

We will pick a scope which makes this more practical, and also more newsworthy: cabinet ministers.

We will need a list to work from, ideally an [official one](https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers#cabinet-ministers)

And you will need their existing [declarations of interests](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-ministers-interests)

## Allocate the work

Each minister will need to be allocated to a different member of the team to research.

## Create three sheets in a shared spreadsheet for data input

A shared spreadsheet will be needed to begin entering data. [Here's an example of how it was done for the Spice Girls](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NVkKlCvdq9-Tv-5jvha4R_rFrOWnfjB2E2m5mAn7ZYM/edit?usp=sharing). 

However, in that example we weren't including family members. So we need the following sheets:

1. A sheet for 'ministers' (each minister). This might include columns for their role, birthdate, etc.
2. A sheet for 'relationships'. This will have a column for each family relationship we can identify, e.g. minister, person connected to, nature of relationship (e.g. wife, husband), source of information, etc. Each minister is likely to appear more than once in this sheet.
3. A sheet for 'directorships', as detailed below. Each minister *and* each person they have a relationship with is likely to appear more than once here.

## Fill in the sheet for ministers

Fill in the sheet for 'ministers' (each minister). This might include columns for their role, birthdate, and any other information which might help you match them to companies etc.

## Fill in the sheet for your minister's family members

Fill in the sheet for 'relationships'. This will have a column for: 

* Relation's name
* Minister's name - this *must match the name in the ministers sheet* (best to create a dropdown menu)
* Type of relationship - again, make sure data entry is consistent by using a limited list (it helps to be non-gender specific, e.g. "spouse" rather than wife or husband, or "child" rather than son/daughter and "parent" rather than father/mother)
* Source of information, etc. 

## Fill in the directorships sheet

The sheet for 'directorships' should have a row for each directorship you can find showing:

* Name of director (this might be a minister, or a member of their family, but *must match the entries in the other sheets exactly*, so a dropdown menu is best used)
* Name of company
* Company number 
* Director URL
* Who entered the data
* Whether it is in their declarations of interests or not (TRUE/FALSE is the best way to enter here)
* Notes

Each time you look at a new company add a row for other directors too. You might find people connected with the politicans whose role you can dig into. 

It is best to start with the existing [declarations of interests](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/list-of-ministers-interests) because this will provide a basis to start exploring other directorships etc.

For example Rishi Sunak declared his wife's directorship of one company, which [can be found on Companies House](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/w0pt3-B9yNGoXPMMiHUGPSyhZeE/appointments), but those details (her full name, date of birth and address) can be used when [searching for her name](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/search/officers?q=akshata%20murty) to confirm that other entries under "Akshata Narayan MURTY" are likely to be the same person.
