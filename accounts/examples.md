# Examples of company accounts

*Copies of all of the following can be found in the examples folder.*

* Chesterfield FC: [CFC 2001 Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04273743/filing-history): example of controversial chairman's statement.
* [Fifty Shades Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07934674/filing-history): stories can be told about how much money an author is making, and whether that is increasing or decreasing.
* [Sainsbury's Annual Report 2017](https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/investors/annual-report-2017): example of the detail provided by accounts for a large listed company.
* [Clink Beer Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10175510/filing-history): example of the detail provided by micro company accounts.
* [Ghetto Golf Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10775584/officers): this company is very new so may not even have accounts. But their page is useful to identify [company officers](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10775584/officers) and other companies they are/have been involved in, whose accounts might also provide more info.
* [DJS (UK) Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07952979/filing-history): example of the detail provided by a small company - there is no profit and loss shown. However, it does detail that the parent company is DJS Holding Limited, and [the accounts for that parent company](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08499088/filing-history) actually show the profit for DJS (UK) Ltd.
* [DJS Holding Ltd](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08499088/filing-history): example of a **dormant** company. Even though it is 'dormant' it still provides details on the profit of the company that it owns, DJS (UK) Ltd.
* [Urban Outreach](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03019108/filing-history) ([also here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/UrbanOutreach2017.pdf)): example of a 'related party transactions' statement which could be further explored.
  * Checking [pages on the director](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/search?q=sam+lancaster) highlights that sometimes the same person has multiple entries - but their address or date of birth is the same.
  * Checking [that person's appointments and their dates](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/x4LVAO9uIaECmE9i-Ql2iVCz5_I/appointments) reveals some other interests that are relevant and perhaps should have been declared.
  * Because it is a charity [you will also find information on trusteeships on the Charity Commission website](http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1044203&subid=0)
  * I tipped off Bolton News reporter Joseph Timan on this lead, resulting in two stories: "[Urban Outreach funded Westhoughton care home](https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17707979.bolton-urban-outreach-funded-westhoughton-woodlands-care-home/)" and [this follow-up: Urban Outreach cleared for Westhoughton care home investment](https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/17713657.urban-outreach-cleared-for-westhoughton-care-home-investment/)
* Declarations of interest should show which companies people have an interest in (e.g. directorships, shareholdings). [This is an example of a declaration for a school board of governors]( http://www.vyners.hillingdon.sch.uk/attachments/download.asp?file=2744&type=pdf)
  * You can check if they've declared everything by searching for them on Companies House. [Here's one search](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07796938/officers) and the [appointments for that person](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/OLzlP_d49cU45o3w8XTXfkZ0qVo/appointments), and [for another](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/-1LyqMyHWGXvjVOi6RFHor_dI-Q/appointments) which don't appear on the declaration.
* A 'Going concern' statement can indicate trouble for an organisation. [This Guardian story on the London Garden Bridge project](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/11/london-garden-bridge-project-future-doubt-trustees) comes from such a statement [in their annual accounts](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/08755461/filing-history)
* Likewise [the Guardian story "South Western Railway may be nationalised after firm loses £137m"](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/07/south-western-railway-may-be-nationalised-after-firm-loses-137m#maincontent) is based on newly released accounts saying that there was "material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern". The company's accounts [can be found here](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07900320/filing-history) and in the examples folder of this repo.
* [This story about a care home company blaming problems on Brexit and council cuts](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/15/debt-laden-four-seasons-health-care-suffers-275m-loss) also comes from a similar statement - you can find it in the [2016 accounts for Four Seasons Health Care](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/FC016792/filing-history)
* [Betfred owners make millions from company treating gambling addicts](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/16/betfred-owners-make-millions-from-company-treating-gambling-addicts) is about the fact that the Done brothers are directors of both Betfred and Health Assured (which treats gambling addiction). [Peter Done's page is here](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/_Vz5jg_Q-jwwpzw5qQI5KSEKUlE/appointments) where you can find both companies and plenty of others. He is resigned as a director of Betfred but his brother isn't.
* [These accounts on the Charity Commission website](http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Accounts/Ends51/0000213251_AC_20170331_E_C.PDF) for leprosy charity [Lepra](http://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=213251&subid=0) highlight the effect of Brexit on exchange rates and reduced value of donations.
* [Carillion's 2016 accounts](http://www.annualreports.co.uk/Company/carillion-plc) provide an example of the problems with **intangible assets**, specifically **goodwill**: as [one comment piece points out](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/23/capita-carillion-outsourcing-local-elections-aditya-chakrabortty): "Carillion repeatedly pulled forward hundreds of millions on profits expected from future work, and paid that cash out to shareholders. Since the huge profits it was booking did not exist, it had to borrow the cash it paid out to shareholders – and the debt was secured against goodwill: its brand name, relations with customers and staff. However hard such things are to value, Carillion reckoned that they were worth a tidy £1.57bn. As MPs discovered to their amazement in January, “goodwill” was Carillion’s single biggest asset."
* [MI Homecare's accounts](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/MI_Homecare_execpay.pdf) show a big cut in staff, while executive pay increased. Check out their entry in gender pay gap data (which is what led me to this company) to get extra context.
* [The accounts for the Centre for Health and Disability Assessments Limited](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/centrehealthdisabiityassessments.pdf) are the basis for [a story in Private Eye on disability benefits, copied here](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/privateeye_cutting.md)
* In mental health there are accounts for [Cygnet Health Care](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/CygnetHealthcare17.pdf) and [Priory Healthcare](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/PrioryHealthcare17.pdf). Both are mentioned in the story '*[NHS pays firms £181m to care for patients with serious mental illness](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/nhs-pays-firms-181m-care-patients-with-serious-mental-illness)*' - you could look at the profit margins being made, the director payouts (there's a big rise in one), or map the extensive network of companies (lots of subsidiaries including property development) and where the money goes, among other aspects.
* In education, the story ['Vanity project': debts pile up for English free schools scheme](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/13/vanity-project-debts-pile-up-for-english-free-schools-scheme) is based on analysis of debts listed in university technical colleges accounts. Look at a company such as [this one](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07898669) to see amount clawed back for under-recruitment and risks identified etc.
* Also in education, [Revealed: how wealthy parents widen cash gap between state schools](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/14/wealthy-parents-stoke-school-divide) is a great example of using the Charity Commission website to [look at accounts for the top-earning parent-teacher associations (PTAs)](https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/?searchText=pta&pageNumber=1): "PTAs, which are unincorporated charities, are not required to register with the Charity Commission unless they earn over £5,000, and the searches will not capture PTAs with non-standard names." They combined a simple search with requests to schools with the largest proportions of pupils on free school meals, and "an analysis of academy accounts [which] found even more extreme examples of private donations made directly to schools (rather than via PTAs). Some academies received more than £1m in direct donations from philanthropists, parents and corporate donors."
* "[Chelsea’s sacking of Antonio Conte cost club £26.6m, accounts reveal](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/07/chelsea-sacking-antonio-conte-cost-26m-accounts-roman-abramovich-danny-drinkwater)" is a straightforward example of a story from the club's [accounts](https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/02536231/filing-history). [Look at the jargon on page 1](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism/blob/master/accounts/exampleaccounts/chelsea2019.pdf) to try to pick it out.
* [Disability testing business gets bailout while paying US parent £56.8m in dividents](https://paulbradshaw.tumblr.com/post/625970431089836032/an-accounts-story-example-from-private-eye), reports Private Eye based on the risks section and financials of the new accounts. The story is newsworthy because the company is controversial.
* Tax: [Amazon UK pays 3% more in tax despite 35% rise in profits](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/sep/08/amazon-uk-pays-3-more-in-tax-despite-35-rise-in-profits) sums up neatly the two parts of the accounts to tell a simple story from: how much profits have increased, and how much tax payments have increased year to year (normally accounts show the current and previous year's figures). This is newsworthy for some companies in particular (e.g. tech and international companies like Starbucks) because they are often accused of avoiding tax by moving money between countries.
* Politics: [Huge wealth of Rishi Sunak's family not declared in ministerial register](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/27/huge-wealth-of-sunaks-family-not-declared-in-ministerial-register) - part of this simply involves tracing his family's directorships and checking if they've been declared. Starting with declared interests you can then [identify the birthdate, full name and address](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/officers/w0pt3-B9yNGoXPMMiHUGPSyhZeE/appointments) to link to [3 other entries for the same person](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/search/officers?q=akshata%20murty)
