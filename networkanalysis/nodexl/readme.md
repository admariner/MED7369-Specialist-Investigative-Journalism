# NodeXL

This folder contains resources related to the Excel plugin for network analysis, NodeXL.

Currently NodeXL only works on Windows-based machines, and not on Mac OS (although you can use a virtual machine to work around this).

The following videos take you through using the tool:

* [Introduction to social network analysis (SNA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmtahzaipXU&feature=youtu.be)
* (Optional: only needed if you don't have Windows on your own machine) [Setting up a virtual machine on AWS to run NodeXL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaanqYAxYJY&feature=youtu.be)
* [Workshop on using NodeXL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53yvni9de8o&feature=youtu.be)

This repo contains the presentations from those videos and other resources.
