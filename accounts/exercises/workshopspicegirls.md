# Workshop: Investigating the business empire of the Spice Girls! 

You have come up with a feature idea to map the various business ventures that the 5 original members of the Spice Girls have been involved in. 

You will need to do the following:

* Find the name one of the Spice Girls’ companies - Victoria Beckham is a good place to start as she’s the most famous entrepreneur from the group. You can find out the name of one of her companies with a quick Google...
Go to beta.companieshouse.gov.uk
* Type in the name of that company and then go to the page for its listing
* Check the Directors tab and find Victoria Beckham’s listing as a director
* You can click on her name to find all the companies she’s listed as a director for
* One is Spice Girls Ltd. Click through to that and then to the company directors of that company to find the other Spice Girls. 

Divide up the Spice Girls between you as a group. You will each research one member. 

Start a spreadsheet to keep track of your research. It should include:

A row for each directorship showing:
* Name of director 
* Name of company
* Company number 
* Director URL
* Who entered the data
* Notes

Each time you look at a new company add a row for other directors too. You might find people connected with the Spice Girls whose role you can dig into. 

Once you’ve made some progress create a visualisation showing the network so far.
