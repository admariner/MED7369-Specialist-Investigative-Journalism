indexes\n","\n","Another way to scrape multiple selectors one way to do that is to use indexes to loop through them. I'll explain what I mean...\n","\n","In the chart scraped above, there are 100 songs listed. When we grab different pieces of information with selectors we end up with 100 titles, 100 artists, 100 positions, and so on.\n","\n","At the moment it loops through the titles like this:\n","\n","```python\n","for i in titles:\n","  title = i.get_text()\n","```\n","\n","However, we could instead loop through a range of numbers:\n","\n","```python\n","for i in range(0,100):\n","  title = titles[i].get_text()\n","```\n","\n","This means that each time we are accessing a different index position in that list `titles`: the first time the loop runs it grabs `titles[0]`; the second time `titles[1]` and so on.\n","\n","The range stops at index `99`, which is fine because that means position 100.\n","\n","Using this approach means we don't need 3 different loops - but can loop through all 3 lists at once in a single loop. The difference is that we will be looping through *numbers*, and using each number to access the item at that *position* in all 3 lists. \n","\n","This is how it works:\n","\n","We loop through numbers from 0 to 99. The first time we loop the number is 0, and we use this to say \"get the item at position 0 in the list 'titles', and position 0 in the list 'artists' and position 0 in the list 'labels'\"\n","\n","We've now grabbed 3 items from 3 lists!\n","\n","Here's the code:"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"yB-TqvSOLs_c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647277970278,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":542,"user":{"displayName":"Paul Bradshaw","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgYQSCAPAX7cikAjthcRciH5mrSmVPNLmT_aEplrw=s64","userId":"01457212023850926122"}},"outputId":"7f805777-e04d-440f-bfe7-6a6d022888a3"},"source":["#Change our dataframe to have 3 columns\n","#We call this dataframe 'df'\n","df = pd.DataFrame(columns=[\"title\",\"artist\",\"label\"])\n","\n","#Create 3 lists that each selects the contents of different tags\n","titles = soup.select('div.title a')\n","artists = soup.select('div.artist a')\n","labels = soup.select('div.label-cat span')\n","#How long is each list?\n","listlength = len(titles)\n","print(listlength)\n","#we loop through a range of numbers rather than the lists themselves\n","for i in range(0,listlength):\n","  #each number in the list generated is called i as it loops\n","  print(i)\n","  #we access the item at that position in the list, and grab its text contents\n","  title = titles[i].get_text()\n","  artist = artists[i].get_text()\n","  label = labels[i].get_text()\n","  print(title, artist, label)\n","  #Now we need to store it in that variable called 'df' \n","  df = df.append({\n","    \"title\" : title,\n","    \"artist\" : artist,\n","    \"label\" : label\n","    }, ignore_index=True)\n","\n","print(df)"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["100\n","0\n","PERFECT ED SHEERAN ASYLUM\n","1\n","RIVER EMINEM FT ED SHEERAN INTERSCOPE\n","2\n","LAST CHRISTMAS WHAM RCA\n","3\n","ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU MARIAH CAREY COLUMBIA\n","4\n","ANYWHERE RITA ORA ATLANTIC\n","5\n","MAN'S NOT HOT BIG SHAQ ISLAND\n","6\n","FAIRYTALE OF NEW YORK POGUES FT KIRSTY MACCOLL WARNER BROS\n","7\n","I MISS YOU CLEAN BANDIT FT JULIA MICHAELS ATLANTIC/POLYDOR/REPUBLIC\n","8\n","DIMELO RAK-SU FT WYCLEF/NAUGHTY BOY SYCO MUSIC\n","9\n","LET YOU DOWN NF EMI\n","10\n","17 MK COLUMBIA\n","11\n","DO THEY KNOW IT'S CHRISTMAS BAND AID MERCURY\n","12\n","HAVANA CAMILA CABELLO FT YOUNG THUG EPIC/SYCO MUSIC\n","13\n","ROCKIN' AROUND THE CHRISTMAS TREE BRENDA LEE MCA\n","14\n","MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE SHAKIN' STEVENS RCA\n","15\n","WOLVES SELENA GOMEZ & MARSHMELLO INTERSCOPE\n","16\n","BARKING RAMZ POLYDOR\n","17\n","STEP INTO CHRISTMAS ELTON JOHN MERCURY\n","18\n","IN YOUR HEAD EMINEM INTERSCOPE\n","19\n","DRIVING HOME FOR CHRISTMAS CHRIS REA WARNER BROS\n","20\n","WALK ON WATER EMINEM FT BEYONCE INTERSCOPE\n","21\n","IT'S BEGINNING TO LOOK A LOT LIKE MICHAEL BUBLE REPRISE\n","22\n","I WISH IT COULD BE CHRISTMAS EVERYDAY WIZZARD EMI\n","23\n","NAKED JAMES ARTHUR SYCO MUSIC\n","24\n","ROCKSTAR POST MALONE FT 21 SAVAGE REPUBLIC RECORDS\n","25\n","NO WORDS DAVE FT MOSTACK DAVE\n","26\n","BEAUTIFUL TRAUMA PINK RCA\n","27\n","I KNOW YOU CRAIG DAVID FT BASTILLE SPEAKERBOX RECORDINGS\n","28\n","MERRY XMAS EVERYBODY SLADE BMG\n","29\n","SILENCE MARSHMELLO FT KHALID MINISTRY OF SOUND\n","30\n","TIP TOE JASON DERULO FT FRENCH MONTANA WARNER BROS\n","31\n","SANTA TELL ME ARIANA GRANDE REPUBLIC RECORDS\n","32\n","BLINDED BY YOUR GRACE -
