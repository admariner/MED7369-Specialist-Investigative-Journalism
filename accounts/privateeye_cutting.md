# Circus Maximus [from Private Eye 1498, June 2019]

US corporation Maximus, which runs test on disabled benefit claimants for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), is paying itself growing dividends from the operation as the DWP is having to spend more and more on appeals against the results of those tests.

Maximus won the contract to run the DWP's work capability assessments in 2015. If it judges a claimant too disabled to work, they are entitled to receive employment and support allowance (ESA) benefit from the DWP. As the latest accounts for Maximus's UK testing company, the Centre for Health and Disability Assessments (CHDA) reveal, it's big business.

Released last month, **the accounts show that in 2018 the DWP paid Maximus £158m. Turnover, which comes entirely from the DWP, fell slightly from 2017 (£161m) but profits actually rose from £26m to £26.7m. More strikingly [parent company] Maximus has started extracting the profit: in 2018 it took £18.1m out of the company in dividends - up from £12m in 2017, the first year it paid itself a dividend.**

Meanwhile, however, the DWP is having to spend similar sums to correct the company's mistakes. Disabled claimants widely view the work capability assessments as unfair and inaccurate. If Maximus judges they are "fit for work" and not entitled to benefits, claimants can ask the DWP to reconsider. If this reconsideration doesn't change the judgement, claimants can ask for a full appeal. 

Under **Freedom of Information** rules, *Private Eye* asked the DWP about appeal costs. Figures for 2017-18 show the DWP spent £24.4m re-examining Maximus findings in reconsiderations and appeals. That was a 40% increase on the £17.3m the DWP spent in 2016-17. The DWP would not give figures for 2018-19, saying they were still being audited.

Claimants launch appeals because they don't have faith in Maximus's testing. According to the **latest outcome figures**, they have good reason. In 2018, around 20 percent of DWP reconsiderations were in the claimants' favour, against Maximus's initial judgement. For full appeals the latest figures show 66% in claimants' favour, showing Maximus's "fit for work" test was wrong, and the claimant was entitled to benefits.

Maximus's own accounts are full of encouraging financial figures - for the company anyway. It claims it carries out "high quality, respectful and fair functional assessments"; but there is a hint that it is aware of problems caused by a shortage of nurses and other testing staff. 

**The accounts say Maximus "continues to remain focused on retention and recruitment levels of health care professionals" and has turned to "various incentive schemes to boost productivity and encourage greater workforce mobility" to ensure it meets its "contractual yearly volume target". In other words, Maximus seems to be offering bonuses to get enough staff to work in the right regions to keep up the numbers.**
